            <p>
              Department of Coffee and Social Affairs primarily sells to United
              Kingdom and European Union addresses. We are only able to accept
              orders in this region through the online shop. We are able to ship
              select items, by prior arrangement, to key international
              destinations. For full information on delivery destinations,
              methods and time frames, as well as our return and exchange

              <strong>TAXES & DUTIES</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              VAT is applied to relevant products on orders to the UK and all EU
              destinations. You will automatically be emailed a VAT receipt. For
              destinations outside of the European Union, we may be able to sell
              products excluding VAT. Any VAT charges are clearly shown in your
              quotation. However, import duties might apply on the product’s
              entry to the destination country. You are responsible for all
              import duties, taxes and any administration charges. These charges
              vary by country and we recommend you contact your local customs
              office for specific information.

              order – then the person who receives the package at the delivery
              address is responsible for the items. If your items are damaged in

              <strong>REFUNDS</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are not satisfied with your purchase, it is possible to
              return the item(s) for exchange or a refund. Items must be
              returned to us in saleable condition within 14 days of delivery
              with a copy your receipt. Please read the Exchange and Return
              Process, which form part of these terms and conditions. Refunds
              will be issued to your original payment method within 14 days of
              receipt. We are commonly able to process refunds in five working
              days. Please note that we are not able to refund or credit
              shipping charges and that we are only able to accept returns of
              coffee if it is defective. This does not affect your statutory
              rights. For options on how to return or exchange items, please
              read Deliveries & Returns.

              <strong>AMENDING OR CANCELLING COFFEE SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              To amend the delivery address of your Coffee Subscription, please
              email us at shop@departmentofcoffee.com. Please note we may
              require proof of address to re-direct your Coffee Subscription and
              that amends should be provided at least 14 days before the end of
              the month for the following month’s delivery. You are able to
              cancel your Coffee Subscription at any time. Please note that
              there is a cancellation fee, which is calculated at half of the
              balance remaining of your Coffee Subscription. For example, if you
              cancelled after eight deliveries of a 12 month subscription, we
              would calculate four twelfths of the subscription price and deduct
              one half to calculate your refund.

              <strong>AMENDING OR CANCELLING COFFEE SCHOOL BOOKINGS</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Coffee School bookings can be amended, changed (subject to
              availability) or transferred up to 14 days before the class.
              Changes inside 14 days are not possible as classes are small and
              we have to book and allocate significant resources to make the
              classes possible. Coffee School bookings may be cancelled up to 30
              days before the class for a full refund. Requests for amends,
              transfers or cancellations can be made by emailing us at
              <a href="mailto:shop@departmentofcoffee.com"
                >shop@departmentofcoffee.com</a
              >
              So we can confirm your identity, please use the email you used to
              make the original booking. If you are wishing to amend or transfer
              your class and your preferred date is not available, we will issue
              an online shop voucher for the value of the booking so that you
              can easily re-book.
